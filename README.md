# RDF Schemas for Phenopackets Version 2

In this repository, SHACL is used to specify the structure of RDF datasets complying to [GA4GH Phenopackets Version 2](https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This schema also incorporates the semantic structure of [GA4GH Variation Representation Specification](https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/index.html) (VRS) for representing genetic variation information.  

The visualization of the RDF shapes for each block of the GA4GH VRS is shown below.
