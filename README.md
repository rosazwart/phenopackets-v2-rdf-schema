# RDF Conversion Workflow: Future Work

This branch contains the work in progress of the improved version of the RDF conversion workflow. The main improvements that are worked on at the moment are also summarized by the added issues to this branch.

The following improvements are needed to be implemented:

- Increase generalization by looking at more model representation syntax possibilities
- Implement the new structures of the JSON templates and generation of a complementary YARRRML file
- Automate the alignment between any given JSON or CSV file and the JSON template generated by the SHACL2YARRRML converter (ideally, a user-friendly UI)
