# RDF Conversion Workflow 

## About the Workflow

Originally, this workflow has been developed to convert a phenopacket v2 dataset to an RDF dataset complying with the [phenopacket v2 conceptual model](https://github.com/LUMC-BioSemantics/phenopackets-rdf-schema/tree/v2) that has been designed to work well on RDF data and align with Care-SM. This final version of the workflow can be found in the main branch with the relevant input and output files. 

In order to develop this workflow further in increasing its generalization over many other SHACL models that might be used as input of this workflow, more SHACL models are looked into. At the moment, the workflow has been tested on the Health-RI metadata model represented in SHACL found [here](https://github.com/Health-RI/health-ri-metadata/tree/v1.0.0/Formalisation(shacl)/Core/PiecesShape). More SHACL design patterns have been introduced by this metadata model which resulted in the workflow to be insufficiently generalized in order to output JSON and YARRRML files that correctly converts to RDF for this model. 

As this RDF conversion workflow proved to be useful for automatic conversion of phenopacket data and insightful about the implications of changes in the SHACL file on the actual data, more development of this tool is recommended. In this branch, the workflow has already been modified to implement the improvements. However, more steps need to be taken to implement the functionalities of the tool to work properly on the new SHACL models. 

## Future Work

This branch contains the work in progress of the improved version of the RDF conversion workflow. The main improvements that are worked on at the moment are also summarized by the added issues to this branch.

The following improvements are needed to be implemented:

- Increase generalization by looking at more model representation syntax possibilities
- Implement the new structures of the JSON templates and generation of a complementary YARRRML file (see Issues)
- Automate the alignment between any given JSON or CSV file and the JSON template generated by the SHACL2YARRRML converter (ideally, a user-friendly UI)
